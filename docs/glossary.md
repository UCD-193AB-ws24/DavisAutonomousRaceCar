### A
- **Actuator**: A device that converts control signals into physical movement (e.g., motors, servos).
- **Algorithm**: A step-by-step procedure for calculations or problem-solving.

### C
- **Controller**: A software or hardware component that determines control actions for the car.
- **Curvature**: The amount by which a geometric object deviates from being straight (used in path planning).

### D
- **Dynamics**: The study of forces and motion in the vehicle.

### G
- **GPS**: Global Positioning System, used for localization.
- **GUI**: Graphical User Interface.

### I
- **IMU**: Inertial Measurement Unit, a sensor that measures acceleration and angular velocity.

### L
- **LiDAR**: Light Detection and Ranging, a sensor for measuring distances.

### O
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: The process of detecting and steering clear of obstacles.
- **Optimizer**: The algorithm or module that computes the optimal solution (e.g., raceline).

### P
- **Path Planning**: The process of determining a path for the vehicle to follow.
- **PID Controller**: Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller, a common feedback control algorithm.

### R
- **Raceline**: The optimal path around a track for minimum lap time.
- **ROS**: Robot Operating System, a middleware for robotics.

### S
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combining data from multiple sensors to improve accuracy.
- **Simulation**: Running the system in a virtual environment.
- **State Estimation**: Determining the current state (position, velocity, etc.) of the vehicle.

### T
- **Trajectory**: The path that a moving object follows through space as a function of time.

### V
- **Velocity Profile**: The planned speed of the vehicle along the raceline or path.
